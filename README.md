### Marco Colombi ID NUMBER 1713520
This is the repository where I put the first homework of the ADM course.
You will discover a .py file and a repository in it.
1. The .py file, called 'Solutions_Marco_Colombi_1713520.py', contains all the solutions to the challenges that I solved.
2. The repository, called 'Screenshots_Colombi_Marco_1713520' contains all the screenshots of the submissions from the HackerRank site (p.s. I made the screenshot of all the challenges that I did on the site, so after the page 19 you will find the submissions of challenges that are not included in the homework).
